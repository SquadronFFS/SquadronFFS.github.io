  <h2>Take-off <small>Procedure</small></h2>

   <p><strong>Understand your bird before you spin her up.</strong>  There are multiple resources for this.  Some of the more important questions to ask:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Do you have a locking tail wheel?</li>
      <li>What is recommended speed to rotate <i>(lift off from runway)</i>?</li>
      <li>Is this plane single brake or Differential brake?</li>
      <li>What engine management concerns are there <i>(Radiators, RPM, Prop Pitch, Manifold Pressure)</i>?</li>
      <li>Do you have all keys mapped given the answers to the above?</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Take-off <small>Configuration</small></h3>
  <p>Before Take-off in the Bf-109 make sure you have <strong>your canopy closed</strong> and <strong>your tail wheel locked</strong>. You will need to straighten out your tail wheel for it to actually lock in place. Set your <strong>flaps to 20°</strong> by extending them until you see two black lines on the flaps on your left wing. Trim your aircraft nose down to <strong>+1 on the adjustable stabilizer</strong> so that your tail wheel will lift off the ground at the appropriate speed.</p>
  <h3>Take-off</h3>
  <p>The Bf-109 has a clockwise rotating propeller when viewed from the cockpit. Due to torque, gyroscopic precession and various aerodynamic effects the plane will have a tendency veer left during take-off. To compensate for this you will need to apply right rudder pressure throughout take-off. </p>
  <p>If you are taking off as part of a flight of aircraft make sure to count 6 seconds before following the aircraft in front of you. When you are ready to go, check that the runway is clear and then slowly throttle up to full power. <ins>By throttling up slowly you reduce the amount of torque on your aircraft and thus, the amount of compensation needed to stay straight during take-off.</ins> </p>
  <p>You can <strong>rotate at 180 <sup><em>𝑘𝑚/ℎ</em></sup></strong>. As soon as you have established a steady climb rate, retract your gear and flaps and reduce your throttle to <strong>1.1 <sup><em>𝑎𝑡𝑎</em></sup></strong> or whatever your section leader calls it out to be.</p>
