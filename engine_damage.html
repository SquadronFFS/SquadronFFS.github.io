    <h1>Engine Damage</h1><hr>
    <article class="row padit">
      <p>
        In IL2 Sturmovik engine damage is modeled very well.  It is modeled so well that understanding how to manage your engine once damaged is worth your time.  <em> A generic damage assessment would consist of validating your control surfaces and the state of your engine.</em>

      <h3>Control Surface Assessment</h3>
      <p>
        In the event of suspected plane or engine damage it is wise to take a quick assessment of what is indeed damaged and be aware of what the impact may be.  First, you need to understand the different parts of your plane and what they do.
      </p><p>A quick over view of control surfaces:
        <ul class="lgray">
          <li><strong>Ailerons - </strong> Controls ability to Roll, can make turning more difficult if damaged.</li>
          <li><strong>Elevators - </strong> Controls pitch, can make climbing and diving more difficult if damaged.</li>
          <li><strong>Rudder - </strong> Controls yaw, can make turning and crabbing on the horizontal plane more difficult.</li>
          <li><strong>Flaps - </strong> Allows you to produce more lift at lower speed, makes landing harder or slow turn fights harder when damaged.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you couldn't already tell <strong>loss of rudder or flaps is not as serious as loss of elevator or ailerons.</strong> Its ultimately a judgment call on the part of the pilot at the time but you may be able to continue combat if damage to the flaps or rudder occurs.  You almost certainly want to disengage if you suffer damage to aileron or elevator.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most damage assessments can be done by quickly glancing at these fundamental parts of the plane. You just need to glance out over both wings and back at your tail.  Note, sometimes your flaps are on the underside of your wing and you can't see them.  Rudder may also not be visible requiring you to asses it via control input.
      </p>
      <p>
        To test via control input (assuming you are not in combat).  Quickly attempt to roll left/right, pitch up/down, and yaw left/right.  Note any sluggishness in response to input as possible damage.  Note that even if you have lost control of your elevator or aileron that might not mean you have lost the ability to trim your aileron or elevator.  In the event of a loss of elevator or aileron try to use trim.  You also may be able to manage the journey home with a loss of say your ailerons by navigation with solely your rudder and elevators. Note, you ever want to try this... dive with a Yak past it's max dive speed.
      </p><p>
        <strong>If after an assessment you don't feel confident you can maintain control of your craft attempt to ditch or belly land depending on your altitude.</strong>
      </p>
      <h3>Engine Assessment</h3>
      <p>
        To asses your engine you want to take note of what is going on outside as well as inside your plane.  In short, check if you are venting any gas or smoke and what your control panel gauges can tell you.  Condensation trails (con-trails) occur at high altitudes and <strong> do not</strong> denote engine damage.
        </p><p>
        If you find you venting (not con-trailing), what color is it:
        <ul class="lgray">
          <li><strong>Venting black smoke - </strong> possible oil line or catastrophic engine damage</li>
          <li><strong>Venting light greenish smoke - </strong> possibly fuel leak.</li>
          <li><strong>Venting white smoke - </strong> possible coolant leak.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Black smoke is very bad, or not.  It's hard to tell, either way you want to plan to disengage and head home.  Green vapor is probably the least threatening.  It just means you are leaking fuel and you can monitor this via your fuel gauge.  You may even still fight with a fuel leak.  <strong>White vapor on the other hand is bad</strong>, it means a coolant leak which tells you engine failure is eminent.  Once you are out of coolant your engine will seize and you don't have a reliable way in most planes to determine when this will occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check your gauges, if you see RPM or water temps "wobbling" or the engine is revving that is a bad sign.  This probably means you don't have long until total engine failure.  <strong>If gauges stay steady then direct your focus to Manifold Pressure, RPM, and/or Prop Pitch.</strong>
