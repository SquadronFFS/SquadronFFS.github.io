    <h1>Engine Damage</h1><hr>

        In IL2 Sturmovik engine damage is modeled very well.  It is modeled so well that understanding how to manage your engine once damaged is worth your time.

      <h3>Control Surface Assessment</h3>
      <p>
        In the event of suspected plane or engine damage it is wise to take a quick assessment of what is indeed damaged and be aware of what the impact may be.  First, you need to understand the different parts of your plane and what they do.  A quick over view of control surfaces:
        <ul class="lgray">
          <li><strong>Ailerons - </strong> Controls ability to Roll, can make turning more difficult if damaged.</li>
          <li><strong>Elevators - </strong> Controls pitch, can make climbing and diving more difficult if damaged.</li>
          <li><strong>Rudder - </strong> Controls yaw, can make turning and crabbing on the horizontal plane more difficult.</li>
          <li><strong>Flaps - </strong> Allows you to produce more lift at lower speed, makes landing harder or slow turn fights harder when damaged.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you couldn't already tell <strong>loss of rudder or flaps is not as serious as loss of elevator or ailerons.</strong> Its ultimately a judgment call on the part of the pilot at the time but you may be able to continue combat if damage to the flaps or rudder occurs.  You almost certainly want to disengage if you suffer damage to aileron or elevator.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most damage assessments can be done by quickly glancing at these fundamental parts of the plane. You just need to glance out over both wings and back at your tail.  Note, sometimes your flaps are on the underside of your wing and you can't see them.  Rudder may also not be visible requiring you to asses it via control input.
      </p>
      <p>
        To test via control input (assuming you are not in combat).  Quickly attempt to roll left/right, pitch up/down, and yaw left/right.  Note any sluggishness in response to input as possible damage.
      </p>
      <h3>Engine Assessment</h3>
      <p>
        To asses your engine you want to take note of what is going on outside as well as inside your plane.  In short, check if you are venting any gas or smoke and what your control panel gauges can tell you.
